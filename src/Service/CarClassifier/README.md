# Classifier Service

This service classifies car models by constant data defined by the client. Some of this information comes from the
database and others are constant as in the examples created, however the idea is the same: just implement a new
ClassifierInterface with your own requirements just like made with Country and a new idea could be to create column in
the table to identify the body type of each model.
